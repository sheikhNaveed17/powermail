                                                With each user, your team is allowed to connect one mail account. When you upgrade the number of users on your team to 5, you're allowed to have up to 5 teammates (including yourself) and up to 5 connected mail accounts.

                                                Note: For customers that have AppSumo plans, your plan has a seat limit and can't be increased beyond that limit. For additional seats beyond that limit, you'll be charged the current pricing. Click here to contact us so we can help add additional seats or click the Contact Us button at the bottom of the page.
                                                When are you billed?
                                                The date that your subscription started is the date you will be billed annually. So if you signed up on June 8th, you'll be billed each year on the June 8th (starting immediately, on June 8th). 
                                                <br><br>
                                                For customers on our legacy monthly plans: You will be billed monthly on the date of the month you started your subscription. For example if you started your subscription on September 20th, you'll be billed on the 20th of each month. If you switch between a yearly and a monthly plan, your recurring date will be updated to the day you made that change.

                                                Does Mailshake charge ahead or behind?
                                                We charge for the upcoming billing period. If you sign up on April 1st, your credit card will be charged on April 1st for your use of Mailshake through May 30th of the next year.

                                                Prorating upgrades
                                                When you upgrade your plan (either by moving to a more expensive plan, increasing users, etc.), you will be charged a prorated amount for the remaining part of the billing period.
                                                <br><br>
                                                You will get to preview these charges before completing your upgrade and when you do, these one-time charges will be collected immediately.

                                                Prorating downgrades
                                                When you downgrade your subscription,  you may end up with a credit on your account. Say you paid for 5 users and then downgraded to 1 partway through the billing period. For our example, we'll say this prorating event gives you a credit of $45 on your account. You are not refunded this amount, but your next Mailshake subscription charge will apply this balance.

                                                <br><br>
                                                When you cancel a subscription, you tell Mailshake to stop billing you. You've already paid for the full billing cycle which means you'll be able to continue using Mailshake until the day your subscription ends. You can view your subscription end date in your Billing settings.

                                                All of your campaign data is deleted 30 days after your subscription expires.

                                                Hibernating
                                                Hibernating is only offered on our legacy monthly plans. Here are the steps to hibernate your team's subscription. Hibernating pauses your billing for a limited period of time (up to 3 months). Mailshake will automatically resume your subscription after the time period you select and we do not delete your campaign data.

                                                Refunds
